## Quick Setup Guide

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

First, make sure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed. Then:

```bash

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your details:

```env
AUTH_TOKEN=your_secret_token_here
MY_NUMBER=919876543210
XAI_API_KEY=your_grok_api_key_here
```

**Important Notes:**

- `AUTH_TOKEN`: This is your secret token for authentication. Keep it safe!
- `MY_NUMBER`: Your WhatsApp number in format `{country_code}{number}` (e.g., `919876543210` for +91-9876543210)
- `XAI_API_KEY`: Your X.AI API key for Grok integration. Get it from https://x.ai/

### Step 3: Run the Backchodi Battle Server

```bash
cd mcp-bearer-token
python backchodi-battle-puch.py
```

You'll see: `üî• Starting Backchodi Battle MCP server on http://0.0.0.0:8086`

2. **Get your authtoken:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

   - Run: `ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTHTOKEN`

3. **Start the tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8086
   ```

You can also deploy this to services like:

- Railway
